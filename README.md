Here is the link: https://marcelinaov.github.io/Professional-Portfolio/.
I use HTML with Materialize and CSS to create the layout and style it, then I used JavaScript to create the functions.
This portfolio includes information and links to the activies I have work on using the skills that I have learn in this past months. The last project included is a fullstack application.
